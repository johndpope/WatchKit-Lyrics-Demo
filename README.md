WatchKit-Lyrics-Demo
====================



This is a simple demo app that does the following:

- recognizes the song you are listening to in the iPod app of your iPhone
- requests the song lyrics to an API
- show them in the screen


Also, it has a Watch target that reads and displays the lyrics!
